TA Amanat provided us with some helpful suggestions, which we have addressed as follows:  
Firstly,  we have added tooltips to certain charts to make them more interactive as per TA Amanat's recommendation.   
Secondly, we had initially planned to incorporate a search option for keywords instead of a dropdown menu, as recommended by TA Amanat. However, due to a heavy workload, we were unable to implement this feature as originally intended. Instead, we added more selection options to the charts to address this concern, as discussed.

Our product is designed to analyze the characteristics of the hottest songs represented in the Billboard Top 100 chart over the years. We extracted indicators that represent the various dimensions of these characteristics. There are three main aspects of characteristics, each with several dimensions.

Regarding user interaction, we believe that our product is user-friendly due to its clear and aesthetically pleasing design, which maintains consistency throughout. We have implemented various visualizations to represent the aforementioned characteristics, including basic bar charts, line charts, pie charts, complex box plots, word cloud plots, stack plots, and compound multi-axis and multi-dimensional plots.

During the implementation and production phase, we discovered that we were unable to fully implement some aspects of our analytic objectives. Specifically, we were not able to include cross-tabulation analysis of artist, lyrics, and tracks, as well as a comprehensive analysis of all dimensions of characteristics, such as yearly variations and comparisons on the same cross-section, simultaneously. This could be the next direction for our product iteration.

Our most interesting finding was that it was more efficient to determine the details of all the graphs and analysis ideas by focusing on the concept of our original goals, rather than getting immersed in the codes, bugs, and dimensions.

The advantages of teamwork were evident in the project, as although everyone had their own tasks, team members actively cooperated in discussions and helped debug any difficulties others encountered.
